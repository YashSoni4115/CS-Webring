## What's a webring?

A webring is a group of websites linked together in a circular manner, centered around a common theme. They were popular in the 90s as a discovery mechanism. The CS Webring connects personal sites and portfolios of current and former CS students, making them more discoverable.

```html
<script>
  new WebringWidget({ theme: 'dark' });
</script>
```

### Custom Container

```html
<div id="my-webring-spot"></div>
<script>
  new WebringWidget({ 
    theme: 'minimal',
    container: '#my-webring-spot'
  });
</script>
```
